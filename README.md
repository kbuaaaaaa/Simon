# Simon
Simon is a computer game developed in C++ with SDL2 Library.
The game started when Bua (the hooman) is too lazy to get out of her bed. Simon has to take care of his lazy hooman.
He went to Buaâ€™s mother and she hired him as a house guard.
Now and then he will use is money to go to the gym where he can increase his strength or to the groomer where he can get a haircut and be a handsome dog. 
Simon can buy Bua gifts to make sure his human is happy.
And when he is handsome and strong enough, cute girl doggo will fall for him.
